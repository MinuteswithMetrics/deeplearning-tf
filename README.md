## How to run the code

The code was tested in **Python 3.5**, but it should probably work in **Python 2.7** too.

1. Clone the repository:
`$ git clone https://github.com/santipuch590/deeplearning-tf.git`

2. Install the dependencies (conda environments are recommended):
```
$ cd deeplearning-tf
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run a Jupyter Notebook to navigate and execute the code:
`$ jupyter notebook`
